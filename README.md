8-2 Journal: Portfolio Item

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  -Review user stories as these are primary their requirements for the program
  -The users are normally engaged by the product owner to elicit their wants and needs for the program
  -If developers do not understand the user story, ask for feedback from the product owner to elaborate

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  -Work should be broken up into multiple segments, each segment can be a user story
  -Make sure to partipcate in all scrum ceremonies
  -Keep scrum board up to date (make sure to update it daily)
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  -Being a good team member is adding value to the project/program/team
  -Ask questions when you're unsure
  -Ask for help when you need it but make sure to try to solve it on your own first
